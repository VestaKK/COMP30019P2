## Teamwork plan/summary

<!-- [[StartTeamworkPlan]] PLEASE LEAVE THIS LINE UNTOUCHED -->

<!-- Fill this section by Milestone 1 (see specification for details) -->

For the most part, the team will make an effort to come together both online
and in person to work on and discuss the development of the game. A discord
channel is created where each team member can communicate with eachother and 
either ask for help or provide feedback to other team members. 

Whilst everyone will have a part in many different aspects of developing the game
we do have people who have expressed interest in specific areas of the project:
- Event Handling/Procedural Generation: Bryn
- Shaders and Graphics Processing: Matthew Pham
- Gameplay and UI: Takumi 
- Particle System and All-Rounder: Matthew Lin

The general plan of progression for the game is as follows:
1. Solidfy Git Workflow and Project File Structure
2. Character Controls and Test Environment
3. Get basic graphics working (main shader style)
4. Event Handling
5. Weapons

For now this is the base plan before we progress on to things like:
1. Enemies and procedural enemy generation
2. Procedural Dungeon generation
3. Player Progression

Milestone 2:
1. Item/Relics & Inventory
2. Improve Dungeon Generation
3. More Enemies
