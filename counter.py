        In this roguelike set in a futuristic cyber-fantasy dystopian Alabama, the player is the victim of twisted experiments conducted by
        <insert evil dude here>, leaving them with the ability to become enraged when on the brink of death. <--- are we going with the vampire cartel as the evil dude?
        Motivated by the need for revenge, the player must fight through hordes of enemies in the Alabama underground (or in the mine? We should decide on this), collecting items and power ups along the way.
        All enemies and rooms will be procedurally generated, with enemies being generated from a set of models and abilities <---- need to decide how we're procedurally generating rooms. We are going for dungeon style right?
        Since being experimented on, the player is losing their concept of humanity, and so to remind them of their humanity there is a familiar cat at each checkpoint that the player can interact with to heal'''
